    <h1>Privacy policy for Android application "Maco SMS"</h1>
    <p>"Maco SMS" requires data about the user's SMS messages to perform its functions. But "Maco SMS" does not store this data and does not transmit it. "Maco SMS" stores only SMS translations that are needed for the application work</p>
    <p>"Maco Sms" uses the Icloud Translation API (translate.googleapis.com) to translate the text into Russian. With each translation, the "Maco Sms" makes two requests: the first request translates the text into Russian, and the second request pre-replaces the letters of the Georgian transliteration with the letters of the Georgian alphabet, and only then sends the text for translation</p>
    <p>The user decides what SMS information he wants to translate. Sending an SMS text occurs through a user action</p>
    <p>"Maco Sms" stores a cache of translated messages in the device's local database and does not transfer any personal data to developers and/or third parties.</p>
